# Work Day Planner

This is a simple work day planner for recording and displaying a day's events. It features text input areas on each hour-long time block that can be saved and will persist across website visits. Additionally, each time block will be color-coded according to its relative position in time to the present: grey for the past, red for the present hour, and green for upcoming hours.
